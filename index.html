        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a freshman studying Computer Science at BYU, with a minor in progress of music. 
          I'm from Jupiter, Florida. I served a mission in Boise, Idaho and Busan Korea. I 
          enjoy video and board games, and I play a number of instruments for fun. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I played around with Scratch in 7th grade, and found I was good at understanding the 
          logic. I also saw an infomercial on how good of a job market was available for 
          computer science. I took all the classes available in high school, and I still liked 
          the subject. Seeing as I was also good at it, and it leads to good careers, I'm 
          pursuing it in college. I've learned a bit of Java, Visual Basic, SQL, Python, C++, 
          and now HTML!
